        <h3>To the Editor:</h3>
        <p>Re <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage">“Trump Shows Mild Symptoms After Positive Test, White House Says”</a> 
        <br> (nytimes.com, Oct. 2):
        We are all saddened at the news of President Trump’s positive coronavirus test. But for the past eight months Mr. Trump has flagrantly disavowed the strong recommendations of the nation’s leading medical experts regarding distancing and masks. Now all those in recent contact with him are concerned for their personal health, as well they should be.

        We can only hope that Mr. Trump will now develop some empathy for those Americans who have lost family members, friends, jobs and businesses, all because of his dishonesty and his politicizing of what he knew early on was an approaching pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>In discussing President Trump’s positive coronavirus test, The Times states that “the positive test could prove devastating to his political fortunes.” However, it is entirely possible that it could give him a boost right when he needs it.

        If Mr. Trump and the first lady have relatively mild illnesses, he and his base could view that as evidence that he has been right all along, that this virus is no worse than the flu, and that a crisis was created by the media and the Democrats to make him look bad.
