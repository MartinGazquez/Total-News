    <small>October 9, 2020</small>
    <p>WASHINGTON — The five U.S. attorneys along the border with Mexico, including three appointed by 
        President Trump, recoiled in May 2018 against an order to prosecute all undocumented immigrants
        even if it meant separating children from their parents. They told top Justice Department officials
        they were “deeply concerned” about the children’s welfare.
    </p>
    <p>But the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, made it clear what Mr. Trump wanted on a conference 
        call later that afternoon, according to a two-year inquiry by the Justice Department’s inspector general 
        into Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy.
    </p>
    <p>“We need to take away children,” Mr. Sessions told the prosecutors, according to participants’ notes.
        One added in shorthand: “If care about kids, don’t bring them in. Won’t give amnesty to people with kids.”
    </p>
    <p>Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general, went even further in a second call about a week later, 
        telling the five prosecutors that it did not matter how young the children were. He said that government
         lawyers should not have refused to prosecute two cases simply because the children were barely more than
        infants.
    </p>
    <p>“Those two cases should not have been declined,” John Bash, the departing U.S. attorney in western Texas, 
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/23/child-separation-migrants-prosecutors-rod-rosenstein">
                     wrote to his staff
            </a>
        immediately after the call. Mr. Bash had declined the cases, but Mr. Rosenstein had 
        overruled him. “Per the A.G.’s policy, we should NOT be categorically declining immigration prosecutions
        of adults in family units because of the age of a child.”
    </p>
    <p>The Justice Department’s top officials were “a driving force” behind the policy that spurred the separation of 
        thousands of families, many of them fleeing violence in Central America and seeking asylum in the United States,
        before Mr. Trump abandoned it amid global outrage, according to a draft report of the results of the investigation
        by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/michael-horowitz-justice-department-inspector-general.html">
            Michael E. Horowitz
           </a> 
        , the department’s inspector general.
    </p>
    <p>The separation of migrant children from their parents, sometimes for months, was at the heart of the Trump 
        administration’s assault on immigration. But the fierce backlash when the administration struggled to reunite 
        the children turned it into one of the biggest policy debacles of the president’s term.
    </p>
    <p>Though Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself from the policy, allowing Mr. Trump and Homeland Security 
        Department officials to largely be blamed, he and other top law enforcement officials understood that
        “zero tolerance” meant that migrant families would be separated and wanted that to happen because they 
        believed it would deter future illegal immigration, Mr. Horowitz wrote.
    </p>
    <p>“The department’s single-minded focus on increasing prosecutions came at the expense of careful and effective
        implementation of the policy, especially with regard to prosecution of family-unit adults and the resulting 
        child separations,” the draft report said.

    </p>
    <p>The draft report, citing more than 45 interviews with key officials, emails and other documents, provides the 
        most complete look at the discussions inside the Justice Department as the family separation policy was developed, 
        pushed and ultimately carried out with little concern for children.
    </p>
    <p>This article is based on a review of the 86-page draft report and interviews with three government officials 
        who read it in recent months and described its conclusions and many of the details in it. The officials, 
        who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss it publicly, 
        cautioned that the final report could change.
    </p>
    <p>Before publishing the findings of its investigations, the inspector general’s office typically provides draft 
        copies to Justice Department leaders and others mentioned in the reports to ensure that they are accurate.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Horowitz had been preparing to release his report since late summer, according to a person familiar with 
        the investigation, though the process allowing for responses from current and former department officials 
        whose conduct is under scrutiny is likely to delay its release until after the presidential election.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Sessions refused to be interviewed, the report noted. Mr. Rosenstein, who is now a lawyer in private practice, 
        defended himself in his interview with investigators in response to questioning about his role, according to two 
        of the officials. Mr. Rosenstein’s former office submitted a 64-page response to the report.
    </p>
    <p>“If any United States attorney ever charged a defendant they did not personally believe warranted prosecution, 
        they violated their oath of office,” Mr. Rosenstein said in a statement. “I never ordered anyone to prosecute a 
        case.”
    </p>
    <p>Gene Hamilton, a top lawyer and ally of Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s assault on immigration, 
        argued in a 32-page response that Justice Department officials merely took direction from the president. 
        Mr. Hamilton cited an April 3, 2018, meeting with Mr. Sessions; the homeland security secretary at the time, 
        Kirstjen Nielsen; and others in which the president “ranted” and was on “a tirade,” demanding as many prosecutions 
        as possible.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Hamilton declined to comment for this article, as did Mr. Horowitz’s office. Mr. Sessions did not respond 
        to requests for comment. Alexa Vance, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, disputed the draft report and 
        said the Homeland Security Department referred cases for prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>“The draft report relied on for this article contains numerous factual errors and inaccuracies,” she said. 
        “While D.O.J. is responsible for the prosecutions of defendants, it had no role in tracking or providing 
        custodial care to the children of defendants. Finally, both the timing and misleading content of this leak 
        raise troubling questions about the motivations of those responsible for it.”
    </p>
    <p>The draft report also documented other revelations that had not previously been known:</p>
    <p>Government prosecutors reacted with alarm at the separation of children from their parents during a 
        secret 2017 pilot program along the Mexican border in Texas. “We have now heard of us taking breastfeeding 
        defendant moms away from their infants,” one government prosecutor wrote to his superiors. “I did not believe 
        this until I looked at the duty log.”
     </p>
     <p>Border Patrol officers missed serious felony cases because they were stretched too thin by the zero-tolerance 
         policy requiring them to detain and prosecute all of the misdemeanor illegal entry cases. One Texas prosecutor 
         warned top Justice Department officials in 2018 that “sex offenders were released” as a result.
    </p>
    <p>Senior Justice Department officials viewed the welfare of the children as the responsibility of other agencies 
        and their duty as tracking the parents. “I just don’t see that as a D.O.J. equity,” Mr. Rosenstein told the 
        inspector general.
    </p>
    <p>The failure to inform the U.S. Marshals Service before announcing the zero-tolerance policy led to serious 
        overcrowding and budget overruns. The marshals were forced to cut back on serving warrants in other cases, 
        saying that “when you take away manpower, you can’t make a safe arrest.”
    </p>
    <p>For two years, Ms. Nielsen has taken the brunt of the public criticism for separating migrant families 
        because of her decision to refer adults crossing the border illegally with children for prosecution. 
        A day after the president’s retreat, Mr. Sessions distanced his department from the decision, 
            <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/393541-sessions-we-never-really-intended-to-separate-families">
            telling CBN News</a>  
        that “we never really intended” to separate children.
    </p>
    <p>That was false, according to the draft report. It made clear that from the policy’s earliest days in a five-month 
       test along the border in Texas, Justice Department officials understood — and encouraged — the separation of 
       children as an expected part of the desire to prosecute all undocumented border crossers.
    </p>
    <p>“It is the hope that this separation will act as a deterrent to parents bringing their children into the harsh 
        circumstances that are present when trying to enter the United States illegally,” a Border Patrol official 
        wrote on Oct. 28, 2017, to the U.S. attorney in New Mexico, according to the draft report.

    <p>After the pilot program in Texas ended, the report asserted, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Rosenstein pushed 
       aggressively to expand the practice across the entire southwestern border, with help from prosecutors.
