    <p>WASHINGTON — The five U.S. attorneys along the border with Mexico, including three appointed by 
        President Trump, recoiled in May 2018 against an order to prosecute all undocumented immigrants
        even if it meant separating children from their parents. They told top Justice Department officials
        they were “deeply concerned” about the children’s welfare.
    </p>
    <p>But the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, made it clear what Mr. Trump wanted on a conference 
        call later that afternoon, according to a two-year inquiry by the Justice Department’s inspector general 
        into Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy.
    </p>
    <p>“We need to take away children,” Mr. Sessions told the prosecutors, according to participants’ notes.
        One added in shorthand: “If care about kids, don’t bring them in. Won’t give amnesty to people with kids.”
    </p>
    <p>Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general, went even further in a second call about a week later, 
        telling the five prosecutors that it did not matter how young the children were. He said that government
         lawyers should not have refused to prosecute two cases simply because the children were barely more than
        infants.
    </p>
    <p>“Those two cases should not have been declined,” John Bash, the departing U.S. attorney in western Texas, 
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/23/child-separation-migrants-prosecutors-rod-rosenstein">
                     wrote to his staff
            </a>
        immediately after the call. Mr. Bash had declined the cases, but Mr. Rosenstein had 
        overruled him. “Per the A.G.’s policy, we should NOT be categorically declining immigration prosecutions
        of adults in family units because of the age of a child.”
    </p>
    <p>The Justice Department’s top officials were “a driving force” behind the policy that spurred the separation of 
        thousands of families, many of them fleeing violence in Central America and seeking asylum in the United States,
        before Mr. Trump abandoned it amid global outrage, according to a draft report of the results of the investigation
        by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/michael-horowitz-justice-department-inspector-general.html">
            Michael E. Horowitz
           </a> 
        , the department’s inspector general.
    </p>
    <p>The separation of migrant children from their parents, sometimes for months, was at the heart of the Trump 
        administration’s assault on immigration. But the fierce backlash when the administration struggled to reunite 
        the children turned it into one of the biggest policy debacles of the president’s term.
    </p>
    <p>Though Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself from the policy, allowing Mr. Trump and Homeland Security 
        Department officials to largely be blamed, he and other top law enforcement officials understood that
        “zero tolerance” meant that migrant families would be separated and wanted that to happen because they 
        believed it would deter future illegal immigration, Mr. Horowitz wrote.
